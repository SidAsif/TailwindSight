  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <p>
    TailwindSight ("the Extension") is a Chrome Developer Tool that allows users to inspect and modify
    Tailwind CSS classes on webpages in real time. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy
    explains how we handle data when you use the Extension.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    TailwindSight does <strong>not collect, transmit, or store</strong> any personal information, browsing data, or usage analytics.
    All operations take place entirely within your browser, and no information leaves your local environment.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Access and Usage</h2>
  <p>
    When you activate TailwindSight on a webpage, the Extension temporarily reads HTML element class attributes
    for the sole purpose of displaying and editing Tailwind CSS classes in the visual inspector.
    This data is processed <strong>locally and temporarily</strong>—it is not saved, transmitted, or shared.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    TailwindSight requests minimal Chrome permissions necessary to function:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Grants temporary access to the currently active tab when you click the extension icon and activate inspection mode.</li>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> Saves the inspection mode state (on/off) locally in your browser. Data never leaves your browser.</li>
    <li><strong>host permissions (&lt;all_urls&gt;):</strong> Required to inspect and modify Tailwind CSS classes on any webpage you choose to work on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These permissions are used strictly to support the Extension's single purpose:
    enabling Tailwind CSS class inspection and editing in real time.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Remote Resources</h2>
  <p>
    TailwindSight uses the Inter font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Fonts</a>
    to ensure consistent typography. This font is loaded via standard CSS and does not execute any JavaScript or collect data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    TailwindSight does not integrate with or send information to any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    TailwindSight does not share, sell, or disclose any data to third parties.
    No data is ever transmitted outside the user's local browser.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since all processing occurs locally in the user's browser, no external servers are involved.
    The Extension is Manifest V3 compliant and follows Chrome's latest security best practices.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect product improvements or changes in legal requirements.
    The "Effective Date" at the top of this page will be updated accordingly. Continued use of TailwindSight
    after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
